# Kubectl_Tools
External Tool to use in IDE (say Pycharm) to Copy Current Test File/Folder to Kubernetes container.
Also, you can run:
* pytest command on Container directly from IDE.
* Run system-test using /ansible/system_test.yml file
* Run any ansible-playbook on container (E.g. ansible-playbook se-setup.yml)

## How to set up Kubectl Tools in IDE
Refer Pycharm [Create/Edit/Copy Tool Dialog!](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/settings-tools-create-edit-copy-tool-dialog.html)

* Click on `+` icon to create a new Tool

### How to Run KubeTools from IDE
* Select the file or folder you want to copy or run tests on container.
* Right Click, Go to `External Tools` and Select your `Kubectl Tool`
* That's all! Keep an eye on the Console/Run Tab :)

#### Notes:
* `ktoolrc.ini` file will be auto-generated when you run the script for the first time.
* When you are running the tool for the first time or when you want to change the Pod Name,
Go to `ktoolrc.ini` file at `$ProjectFileDir$` and add/change the value for `podname` field.
* This is one time task per Pod Name change.
* Delete the `ktoolrc.ini` file from your `$ProjectFileDir$`,
if you make any code changes in this repository as all the constants
are picked up by the `ini` file.
* Add `ktoolrc.ini` to your projects `.gitignore` file if required.
* Currently, this tool supports requires Python3+ (As Python2.7 is deprecated)

### Errors:
* `Cannot Run Program /path/kube_tools.py; [error=2] No such file or directory`
  - The files are basically Python scripts. i.e., we use `#!/usr/bin/python3` in the beginning of these script files.
  - Make sure you have **Python3** set to `/usr/bin/python3`.
  - Else Replace the line `#!/usr/bin/python3` in `kube_tools*.py` files, with whichever location you have **Python3** configured.
    - For Eg: `/user/local/bin/python3`

* Unable to run kubectl commands?
  - Before using this tool, make sure you have kubectl package installed in your system.
  - Make sure basic kubectl commands are working on your namespace.
